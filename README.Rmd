# lump.split.pool.ENM

The goal of lump.split.pool.ENM is to facilitate running simulations to compare different approaches for ecological niche modelling: lumping, splitting taxa, and fit models that perform partial pooling (GLMM and PGLMM). See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.10.012) or [these slides](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12479750.v1) for more information.
